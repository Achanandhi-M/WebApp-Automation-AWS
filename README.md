## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to set up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment of a simple web application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk whenever changes are pushed to the repository. Below are the key components of the project:

- **Web Application**: A simple web application that is hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: The CI/CD pipeline is defined using AWS CodePipeline and includes the following stages:
  - **Source**: Pulls the code from the repository.
  - **Build**: Builds the application using AWS CodeBuild.
  - **Deploy**: Deploy the application to Elastic Beanstalk using CodePipeline to Elastic Beanstalk integration.

## Requirements

To set up and use this CI/CD pipeline, you need the following requirements:

- An AWS account with the necessary permissions.
- An AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment for hosting the web application.
- A GitHub repository to host the source code.
- An AWS CodeBuild project for building the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- AWS account credentials configured on your local machine.
- AWS CLI and AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI (EB CLI) installed.
- GitHub repository with your web application code.

### Setup

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: Create a new repository for your web application on GitHub.

2. **Configure AWS Services**:
   - Set up an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment to host your application.
   - Create an AWS CodeBuild project for building your application.

3. **Create AWS CodePipeline**:
   - Set up an AWS CodePipeline that defines the source, build, and deploy stages.

4. **Configure Automatic Trigger**:
   - Configure the pipeline to be triggered automatically whenever there is a change to the code in your GitHub repository.

5. **Deploy the Pipeline**:
   - Deploy the configured pipeline in AWS.

## Pipeline Stages

The CI/CD pipeline is composed of the following stages:

- **Source Stage**:
  - This stage pulls the code from your GitHub repository whenever changes are pushed.

- **Build Stage**:
  - This stage builds the application using AWS CodeBuild, ensuring that your application is ready for deployment.

- **Deploy Stage**:
  - This stage deploys the application to the Elastic Beanstalk environment using CodePipeline's integration.

## Automated Testing 

You can add automated tests to your application and configure the pipeline to run these tests before deploying the application.

## Deployment

Your web application will be automatically built, tested (if configured), and deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk whenever changes are pushed to your GitHub repository.
